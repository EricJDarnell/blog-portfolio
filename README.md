Hello,
My name is Eric Darnell, this is my portfolio site, as well as a development blog for my projects. I will include some class projects that I put together to demonstrate my abilities, and how they continue to grow and evolve over time. I hope that this will function as a landing page for myself, and that I can demonstrate that I will be an asset to any development team. I intend to demonstrate that I can pick up new technologies when required.
I will also demonstrate some side projects that I am building. Goals for the projects I will be demonstrating:
1. Little Vintage Florist website.
2. Holding Jeremy to Account (your taxes)
3. Room 5 Destination Review.
4. Puppy Bowl
5. BookBuddy
6. PuppyBowl React.
